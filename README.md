# AzureDiagnosticSettings

This project is designed to assist IT teams to rapidly configure security logging for core Azure resource types. It uses Azure Policy to ensure that all current & future Azure Resources are configured with the log collection standards.

Initial deployment takes about 30-45 minutes (larger tenants take longer). AzureDiagnosticSettings 2.0 also includes an Azure Automation Runbook that runs every 24 hours to ensure compliance with the logging standards of each tier.

The Log Analytics Workspace is parameterized so you can do a split schema and send Tier1/Tier2 logs to a Sentinel-enabled LAW and send Tier3 to a non-Sentinel-enabled LAW (Azure Monitor Workspace). This is strongly recommended if you are deploying Tier3.
